      Dear <%= @user.first_name %>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Master of Code Global strives to evolve feedback culture that helps us build a strong community with healthy culture and collaboration.
      <br>
      <br>
      As a part of Performance Management and Appraisal System it is high time to ask for <b>your own feedback</b> that aims at Self Assessment regarding job knowledge, work quality, work rate, communications, interpersonal relations, policy compliance, activity, your strength and areas for improvement, and remuneration review expectations. <a href="<%= apr_feedbacks_url(params: { master: true }, host: masters_url_host) %>" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#FD5D32; text-decoration: none">Please, fill in the Self Assessment form in MastersModule feedback by <%= @session.to.strftime('%d.%m.%Y') %></a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      Following 360 degree flow, we ask you to prove a <b>list of peers</b> you were closely collaborating with for the past 6 months in the team(s) and/or project(s). <a href="<%= apr_feedbacks_url(params: { master: true, tab: 'self' }, host: masters_url_host) %>" target="_blank" rel="noopener" style="color:#FD5D32; text-decoration: none">Please, use MastersModule and choose the list of peers by <%= (3.business_days.after(@session.from)).strftime('%d.%m.%Y') %></a>.
      <br>
      <br>
      As soon as we have your feedback and collect feedback from the team, we would be glad to share it with you at the Feedback Session.
      <br>
      <br>
      If you have any questions or comments, feel free to contact your People Partner.

      Thank you!
